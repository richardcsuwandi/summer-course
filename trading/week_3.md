<!-- **Week 3 (Days 15-21): Intermediate Technical Analysis & Indicators** -->

*   **Day 15: Introduction to Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)**
    *   **Topic:** Using lagging indicators to identify trends and smooth price action.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculation and interpretation. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) calculation and its sensitivity to recent prices. Using MAs as dynamic support/resistance. MA Crossovers (Golden Cross, Death Cross) as trade signals.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply 20-period SMA, 50-period SMA, and 200-period SMA to several stock charts on daily timeframes. Observe how they track the price. Identify instances of Golden Crosses and Death Crosses and note subsequent price action. Compare SMA vs. EMA of the same period (e.g., 20-period).

*   **Day 16: Introduction to Technical Indicators: Volume Analysis**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding the significance of trading volume in confirming trends and patterns.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Volume as a measure of conviction. Volume confirming trends (increasing volume in trend direction). Volume spikes on breakouts. Divergence between price and volume. On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Add a volume indicator to your charts. Analyze volume patterns during significant price moves (trends, breakouts from patterns). Calculate and plot OBV for a few stocks and see how it corresponds to price trends.

*   **Day 17: Oscillators: Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
    *   **Topic:** Measuring the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
    *   **Key Concepts:** RSI calculation (conceptual understanding). Overbought (typically >70) and Oversold (typically <30) levels. RSI Divergence (bullish and bearish) as a potential reversal signal. Using RSI for trend confirmation.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply RSI (standard 14-period) to several stock charts. Identify overbought/oversold readings and observe subsequent price action. Look for examples of bullish and bearish RSI divergence.

    *   **Key Concepts:** MACD Line (difference between two EMAs, typically 12 & 26). Signal Line (EMA of MACD Line, typically 9-period). MACD Histogram (difference between MACD Line and Signal Line). Bullish/Bearish Crossovers. Centerline Crossovers. MACD Divergence.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply MACD to your charts. Identify MACD line/signal line crossovers and centerline crossovers. Look for examples of MACD divergence with price.

    *   **Key Concepts:** %K line and %D line. Overbought (>80) and Oversold (<20) levels. Stochastic Crossovers. Stochastic Divergence.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply the Stochastic Oscillator to your charts. Compare its signals (overbought/oversold, crossovers, divergence) with those from RSI and MACD on the same chart. Note similarities and differences.

*   **Day 20: Volatility Indicators: Bollinger Bands**
    *   **Topic:** Measuring market volatility and identifying potential breakouts.

    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply Bollinger Bands to your charts. Identify periods of Bollinger Squeeze and observe subsequent breakouts. Note how price interacts with the upper and lower bands during strong trends versus ranging markets.

Write a short analysis for each stock, describing what the combination of indicators suggests about the current trend, momentum, and volatility. Start thinking about how you might combine 2-3 indicators to form a basic trading signal. Continue paper trading, incorporating these indicators.
