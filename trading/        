*   **Day 12: Introduction to Technical Indicators: Moving Averages**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding and applying moving averages, one of the most popular technical indicators.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Calculation differences and responsiveness. Using MAs for trend identification, dynamic support/resistance, and crossover signals (e.g., 50-day MA crossing above 200-day MA - Golden Cross, or below - Death Cross).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** On several stock charts, apply different period SMAs (e.g., 20, 50, 200-day) and EMAs (e.g., 12, 26-day). Observe how they smooth price action and identify potential buy/sell signals based on crossovers and price interaction with the MAs. Compare the responsiveness of SMA vs. EMA for the same period.

*   **Day 13: Introduction to Technical Indicators: Volume Analysis**
    *   **Topic:** The importance of trading volume in confirming price trends and patterns.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Volume as a measure of market participation and conviction.

Introduction to On-Balance Volume (OBV) as a momentum indicator based on volume flow.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** For the chart patterns and breakouts you identified on Day 11, analyze the volume action accompanying them. Did volume confirm the breakouts? Apply the OBV indicator to a few charts and observe its relationship with price trends.

*   **Day 14: Review & Charting Practice - Week 2**
    *   **Topic:** Consolidating knowledge from the second week on introductory technical analysis.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Review of Dow Theory, chart types, timeframes, basic candlestick patterns, support/resistance, trendlines, basic chart patterns, moving averages, and volume analysis.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Select 5 new stock charts you haven’t analyzed before. Apply all the concepts learned this week: identify trends, draw S&R and trendlines, look for candlestick and chart patterns, apply moving averages, and analyze volume. Document your analysis for each chart. Start a “chartbook” of interesting setups.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Revisit resources from Days 8-13.

**Week 3 (Days 15-21): Intermediate Technical Analysis & Indicators**

*   **Day 15: Oscillators: Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding and using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator.
    *   **Key Concepts:** RSI calculation (conceptual understanding). Identifying overbought (typically >70) and oversold (typically <30) conditions. Bullish and bearish divergence between RSI and price as potential reversal signals.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply the RSI (standard 14-period) to several stock charts. Identify instances of overbought/oversold conditions and look for corresponding price reactions. Search for examples of bullish and bearish divergence and note the subsequent price action.

*   **Day 16: Oscillators: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding and using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) trend-following momentum indicator.
    *   **Key Concepts:** MACD Line (difference between two EMAs), Signal Line (EMA of the MACD Line), and Histogram (difference between MACD Line and Signal Line). Interpreting MACD crossovers (MACD line crossing above/below signal line) as buy/sell signals. Identifying bullish and bearish divergence.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply the MACD (default settings, e.g., 12, 26, 9) to stock charts. Identify crossover signals and divergences. Compare MACD signals with RSI signals on the same charts. Do they confirm or contradict each other?
