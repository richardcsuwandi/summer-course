# ðŸ§® Advanced Topics & Machine Learning in Trading

*   **Day 75: Sentiment Analysis for Trading**
    *   **Topic:** Exploring how market sentiment, derived from text sources, can be used in trading.
    *   **Key Concepts:** News Sentiment (analyzing financial news articles), Social Media Sentiment (analyzing platforms like X/Twitter, StockTwits). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Potential for sentiment as a confirming or leading indicator.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Explore a pre-built sentiment analysis tool or API (some offer free tiers for limited use, e.g., search for "free stock news sentiment API"). Alternatively, use Python's NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or TextBlob library with a pre-trained model to analyze the sentiment of a few financial news headlines for a specific stock. Note the sentiment scores.

*   **Day 76: Introduction to Machine Learning for Trading**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding the potential and challenges of applying Machine Learning (ML) to financial markets.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Supervised Learning (e.g., regression for price prediction, classification for buy/sell signals), Unsupervised Learning (e.g., clustering similar stocks). Common ML algorithms used in finance (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests - very high-level overview).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Read 2-3 introductory articles or blog posts on the application of machine learning in trading. Focus on understanding the types of problems ML can address in finance and the unique challenges (non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratio).

*   **Day 77: Feature Engineering for ML Trading Models**
    *   **Topic:** Creating meaningful input variables (features) for machine learning models from raw financial data.
    *   **Key Concepts:** What is feature engineering? Why is it crucial for ML model performance? Examples of features: lagged returns, technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD values), volatility measures, price momentum, volume-based features.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Using one of your stock DataFrames in Python, brainstorm and implement the calculation of at least 5-7 different features that could potentially be used to predict next day's price movement (e.g., 1-day lagged return, 5-day lagged return, 20-day SMA, RSI value, difference between price and 50-day SMA).

*   **Day 78: Building a Simple ML Model for Price Prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression using scikit-learn)**
    *   **Topic:** Training a basic machine learning model to predict a binary outcome (e.g., price up/down).
    *   **Key Concepts:** Using `scikit-learn` Python library. Preparing data: defining features (X) and target variable (y - e.g., 1 if next day price up, 0 if down). Splitting data into training and testing sets. Training a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression). Making predictions on the test set.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project (Part 1):** Using your features from Day 77 and a stock DataFrame: 
        1.  Create a binary target variable (e.g., will the next day's close be higher than today's close?).
        2.  Split your data into a training set (e.g., first 70-80%) and a testing set (e.g., last 20-30%).
        3.  Train a Logistic Regression model using `scikit-learn` on the training data.
        4.  Make predictions on the testing data.
        Focus on the process, not on achieving high accuracy at this stage.
