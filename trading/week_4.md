*   **Day 26: Paper Trading with a Plan & Journal**
    *   **Topic:** Applying your trading plan and journaling practices in a simulated environment.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Executing trades strictly according to your drafted trading plan. Recording every trade in your journal immediately after execution or closing.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Dedicate the session to paper trading. Make at least 5-10 paper trades based *only* on the rules in your trading plan. For each trade, fill out your trading journal completely.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your trading plan, your journal, your Interactive Brokers paper trading platform.

*   **Day 27: Analyzing Paper Trading Results & Refining Plan**
    *   **Topic:** Learning from your simulated trading performance.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Reviewing journal entries: Win rate, Average win/loss, Risk/Reward achieved, Common mistakes, Strategy performance. Identifying areas for improvement in your trading plan or execution.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Review all the paper trades you've journaled so far. Calculate your win rate and average risk/reward. Identify the top 1-2 mistakes you're repeatedly making. Make small adjustments to your trading plan based on these observations.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your trading journal.

*   **Day 28: Introduction to Python for Finance: Setting up Environment**
    *   **Topic:** Preparing your computer for Python-based financial analysis.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Why Python for finance? Anaconda distribution (includes Python, Jupyter, key libraries). Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding. Basic Python syntax overview (variables, data types, loops, functions - if completely new to Python, spend more time here).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Install Anaconda on your computer. Launch a Jupyter Notebook. Write a simple Python script (e.g., print "Hello, Finance World!", perform basic arithmetic).
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Anaconda Download: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

*   **Day 29: Python Libraries for Finance: NumPy & Pandas Basics**
    *   **Topic:** Introduction to essential Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
    *   **Key Concepts:** NumPy: Numerical Python, ndarray objects for efficient array operations. Pandas: Data analysis library, DataFrame and Series objects for handling tabular data (like stock prices).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** In a Jupyter Notebook: 
        1.  Create NumPy arrays and perform basic arithmetic operations on them.
        2.  Create a simple Pandas Series and a DataFrame from a Python dictionary.
        3.  Practice selecting data from your DataFrame (rows, columns, specific cells).

*   **Day 30: Review of Month 1 & Python Setup**
    *   **Topic:** Consolidating knowledge from the first month and ensuring Python environment is ready.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Review trading psychology, risk management, trading plans, journaling, and basic Python/NumPy/Pandas concepts.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Review your trading plan and journal. Ensure your Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook environment is working correctly. Write a short Python script in a Jupyter Notebook that creates a Pandas DataFrame with hypothetical stock data (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume for a few days) and calculates the daily price range (High - Low) for each day, storing it as a new column. This integrates your learning from the past few days.
