# ðŸ’» Introduction to Quantitative Trading & Python

*   **Day 45: What is Quantitative Trading?**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding the systematic, data-driven approach to trading.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Definition of quantitative trading. Systematic vs. discretionary trading. Role of data analysis, statistical modeling, and automation. Alpha generation, risk management, and execution in quant trading. Overview of different quant strategies (e.g., statistical arbitrage, momentum, mean reversion - high level).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Read 2-3 articles from QuantStart.com or Quantpedia.com that provide an overview of quantitative trading. Write a short summary of what you understand quantitative trading to be and how it differs from purely technical or fundamental approaches.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**

*   **Day 46: Introduction to Backtesting: Concepts & Importance**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding how to test trading strategies on historical data.
    *   **Key Concepts:** What is backtesting? Why is it crucial? Historical simulation of trading rules. Key components of a backtest: data, strategy logic, assumptions (commissions, slippage), performance metrics. Dangers: overfitting, lookahead bias, survivorship bias.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Read articles explaining backtesting concepts and common pitfalls. Watch a YouTube video that walks through a conceptual backtest of a simple strategy.

*   **Day 47: Key Performance Metrics for Backtesting**
    *   **Topic:** Quantifying the performance of a backtested trading strategy.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Total Return/P&L. Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return). Sortino Ratio. Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Win Rate. Average Win/Loss. Profit Factor. Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Understanding what each metric tells you about a strategy's performance and risk.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Create a spreadsheet or document listing these key performance metrics. For each metric, write a short definition and explain what it measures. Research typical acceptable ranges or benchmarks for some of these metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio > 1 is often considered good).

        *   Quantpedia - Performance Metrics (various articles).

*   **Day 48: Vectorized vs. Event-Driven Backtesting (Conceptual)**
    *   **Topic:** Understanding the two main approaches to building backtesting engines.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Vectorized Backtesting: Uses array operations (e.g., with Pandas/NumPy) for speed, suitable for simpler strategies without path dependency. Event-Driven Backtesting: Simulates trading tick-by-tick or bar-by-bar, more realistic for complex strategies, handles path dependency and portfolio effects better, but slower.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Read articles comparing vectorized and event-driven backtesting. Understand the pros and cons of each. For a simple SMA crossover strategy, think about how it could be implemented in a vectorized way versus an event-driven way (conceptually).
    *   **Recommended Resources:**

        *   Blog posts comparing "vectorized vs event driven backtesting python".

*   **Day 49: Designing a Simple Vectorized Backtester in Python (SMA Crossover - Part 1: Signals)**
    *   **Topic:** Starting to implement a basic backtester using Pandas for a simple strategy.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Using Pandas to calculate indicators (e.g., SMAs from Day 43). Generating trading signals (e.g., 1 for buy, -1 for sell, 0 for hold) based on indicator crossovers. Creating a `signal` column in your DataFrame.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Take your stock DataFrame with SMAs (e.g., 20-day and 50-day). 
        1.  Create a new column for signals: Assign 1 when short SMA crosses above long SMA (buy signal). Assign -1 when short SMA crosses below long SMA (sell signal). Be careful with `shift()` to avoid lookahead bias (signals should be based on data available *before* the trade).
        2.  Print the DataFrame rows where signals are generated.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your Python code from Day 43, Pandas documentation on `shift()` and conditional assignments.

*   **Day 50: Implementing a Simple Vectorized Backtester (SMA Crossover - Part 2: Positions & Returns)**
    *   **Topic:** Calculating positions and strategy returns from signals.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Translating signals into positions (e.g., assuming you are in the market long after a buy signal until a sell signal). Calculating daily strategy returns based on your position and the stock's daily returns. Calculating cumulative strategy returns.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Continue with your SMA crossover project:
        1.  Create a `position` column from your `signal` column (e.g., `df["position"] = df["signal"].shift(1)` to reflect holding the position on the day *after* the signal).
        2.  Calculate daily stock returns (`df["stock_returns"] = df["Close"].pct_change()`).
        3.  Calculate daily strategy returns (`df["strategy_returns"] = df["position"] * df["stock_returns"]`).
        4.  Calculate and plot cumulative strategy returns alongside cumulative stock returns using Matplotlib.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Pandas documentation, Matplotlib documentation.

*   **Day 51: Review of Week 7 & Basic Backtesting Concepts**
    *   **Topic:** Consolidating knowledge of quantitative trading, backtesting, and initial Python implementation.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Review quant trading, backtesting principles, performance metrics, vectorized vs. event-driven, and your Python SMA crossover backtest progress.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Refine your Python SMA crossover backtester. Add comments to your code. Calculate a few basic performance metrics for your strategy (e.g., total return). Compare the strategy's cumulative return plot to the buy-and-hold plot. What are your initial observations? Document any challenges faced.
