# ⚙️ Building a Simple Backtester in Python

*   **Day 52: Improving the Vectorized Backtester: Adding Basic Costs**
    *   **Topic:** Making the simple backtester slightly more realistic.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Incorporating a fixed per-trade commission cost. Subtracting commission costs when a trade (change in position) occurs. Understanding how costs impact performance.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Modify your Python SMA crossover backtester from Day 50/51. Assume a small commission cost (e.g., $0.005 per share, or a flat $1 per trade). Deduct this cost from the strategy returns whenever a trade is initiated (i.e., when the position changes). Re-plot cumulative returns and compare with the no-cost version.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your Python code, logic for identifying trades.

*   **Day 53: Calculating More Performance Metrics in Python**
    *   **Topic:** Programmatically calculating Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Sharpe Ratio formula (assuming a risk-free rate, e.g., 0). Calculating daily returns, mean daily return, standard deviation of daily returns. Annualizing Sharpe Ratio. Max Drawdown: calculating cumulative returns, then finding the largest peak-to-trough decline.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Extend your Python backtester to calculate and print:
        1.  Annualized Sharpe Ratio (e.g., daily Sharpe * sqrt(252) assuming 252 trading days).
        2.  Maximum Drawdown.
        Compare these metrics for your SMA crossover strategy with and without transaction costs.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** NumPy and Pandas for calculations. Online articles for Python implementation of Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

*   **Day 54: Introduction to Backtesting Libraries: `backtrader` (Overview & Setup)**
    *   **Topic:** Exploring dedicated Python libraries for more sophisticated backtesting.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Why use a library? (Handles data, events, orders, metrics, plotting). Overview of `backtrader`: features, structure (Cerebro engine, Strategies, Data Feeds, Analyzers, Observers). Installation of `backtrader`.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Install `backtrader` (`pip install backtrader`). Read the `backtrader` Quickstart Guide from its official documentation. Run the simple example strategy provided in the Quickstart to ensure your installation is working.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Backtrader Documentation: [https://www.backtrader.com/docu/](https://www.backtrader.com/docu/)
        *   Backtrader GitHub: [https://github.com/mementum/backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader)

*   **Day 55: Implementing SMA Crossover Strategy with `backtrader` (Part 1: Strategy Class)**
    *   **Topic:** Writing your first strategy using the `backtrader` framework.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Creating a Strategy class inheriting from `bt.Strategy`. `__init__` method: defining indicators (e.g., `bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage`). `log` method for printing trade info. `next` method: core strategy logic (checking conditions, placing orders).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Create a Python script using `backtrader`. Define a new strategy class for the SMA crossover (e.g., 20-day and 50-day SMAs). In the `__init__` method, define your SMAs. In the `next` method, implement the logic to check for crossovers. (No orders yet, just print when a crossover occurs).
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Backtrader documentation (Strategy section, Indicator section).

*   **Day 56: Implementing SMA Crossover Strategy with `backtrader` (Part 2: Orders & Cerebro)**
    *   **Topic:** Adding order execution and running the backtest with `backtrader`.
    *   **Key Concepts:** `Cerebro` engine setup. Adding a Data Feed (e.g., using `bt.feeds.PandasData` with your CSV data or `bt.feeds.YahooFinanceCSV`). Adding the Strategy to Cerebro. Setting initial cash. `buy()` and `sell()` order methods. Running Cerebro. Basic plotting with `cerebro.plot()`.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** **Project:** Extend your `backtrader` SMA crossover script:
        1.  Set up the Cerebro engine.
        2.  Load your stock data (e.g., from a CSV file you downloaded earlier).
        3.  In your strategy's `next` method, use `self.buy()` when a buy signal occurs (if not already in market) and `self.sell()` or `self.close()` for sell signals/exits.
        4.  Run the backtest and use `cerebro.plot()` to visualize results.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Backtrader documentation (Cerebro, Data Feeds, Order Execution sections).

*   **Day 57: Analyzing `backtrader` Results: Analyzers & Observers**
    *   **Topic:** Extracting detailed performance metrics and insights from `backtrader`.
    *   **Key Concepts:** `Analyzers` in `backtrader` (e.g., `SharpeRatio`, `DrawDown`, `TradeAnalyzer`, `SQN`). Adding analyzers to Cerebro. Accessing analyzer results. `Observers` for plotting additional data on charts (e.g., `Cash`, `Trades`).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Modify your `backtrader` script to include analyzers for Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, and TradeAnalyzer. Print the results from these analyzers after running the backtest. Add the `Cash` and `Trades` observers and see how they appear on the plot.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Backtrader documentation (Analyzers, Observers sections).

*   **Day 58: Comparing Your Vectorized Backtest with `backtrader` Results**
    *   **Topic:** Validating your understanding and implementation by comparing two different backtesting approaches.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Differences in implementation details (e.g., how trades are executed, how returns are calculated, handling of initial conditions). Understanding why results might differ slightly. Importance of clear assumptions in any backtest.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Compare the cumulative return plot and key performance metrics (Sharpe, MDD) from your manual vectorized backtester (from Day 53) with those from your `backtrader` implementation for the SMA crossover strategy on the same stock and period. Document any significant differences and try to understand their cause.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your Python scripts, `backtrader` documentation.

*   **Day 59: Introduction to Other Backtesting Libraries (Zipline, PyAlgoTrade - Overview)**
    *   **Topic:** Awareness of other popular Python backtesting frameworks.
    *   **Key Concepts:** `Zipline`: Powers Quantopian, event-driven, good for portfolio-level backtesting. `PyAlgoTrade`: Event-driven, older but still used. Brief overview of their features and typical use cases compared to `backtrader`.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Visit the GitHub pages or documentation for Zipline (Quantopian fork) and PyAlgoTrade. Read their introductory sections to get a feel for their structure and capabilities. (No coding required, just familiarization).
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Zipline (Community Maintained): [https://github.com/stefan-jansen/zipline-reloaded](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/zipline-reloaded) (or search for active forks)

*   **Day 60: Review of Month 2 & Backtesting Foundations**
    *   **Topic:** Consolidating knowledge of practical strategies and backtesting in Python.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Review common trading strategies, Python data handling, backtesting concepts, performance metrics, and your experience with manual vectorized backtesting vs. `backtrader`.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Write a summary comparing your experience building a vectorized backtester manually versus using `backtrader`. What were the pros and cons of each? Which approach would you prefer for more complex strategies and why? Ensure your `backtrader` SMA crossover script is well-commented and saved. Continue paper trading, focusing on strategies with clear, testable rules.
