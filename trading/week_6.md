# üîç Advanced Technical Analysis & Pattern Recognition

<!-- **Week 6 (Days 38-44): Advanced Technical Analysis & Python Visualization** -->

*   **Day 38: Advanced Candlestick Patterns**
    *   **Topic:** Recognizing more complex multi-candle patterns.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Three White Soldiers, Three Black Crows, Morning Star/Evening Star (detailed breakdown), Tweezer Tops/Bottoms, Island Reversals. Understanding the psychology behind these patterns.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Scan historical charts for examples of these advanced candlestick patterns. Note their reliability and the context in which they appeared (e.g., at S/R levels, during a trend).
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Book: "Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques" by Steve Nison.
        *   Investopedia - Advanced Candlestick Patterns (search for specific patterns).

*   **Day 39: Advanced Chart Patterns (Cup and Handle, Wedges, Rectangles)**
    *   **Topic:** Identifying more nuanced chart formations.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Cup and Handle (bullish continuation). Wedges (Rising and Falling - typically reversal patterns). Rectangles (continuation patterns, trading ranges). Measuring implications and volume characteristics.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Look for examples of Cup and Handle, Wedges, and Rectangles on historical stock charts. Practice identifying their breakout points and measuring potential price targets.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Investopedia - Cup and Handle: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp)
        *   Investopedia - Wedge: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wedge.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wedge.asp)
        *   StockCharts.com - ChartSchool (for various patterns).

*   **Day 40: Fibonacci Retracements & Extensions**
    *   **Topic:** Using Fibonacci ratios to identify potential support/resistance levels and price targets.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Fibonacci sequence and key ratios (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 261.8%). Drawing Fibonacci Retracements on a price swing to find potential pullback levels. Using Fibonacci Extensions to project potential price targets.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Apply Fibonacci Retracement tool to significant price swings on several charts. Observe if price reacts at these levels. Practice using Fibonacci Extension tool to project targets after a breakout or a new swing.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Investopedia - Fibonacci Retracement Levels: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp)
        *   Investopedia - Fibonacci Extension: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciextensions.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciextensions.asp)

*   **Day 41: Combining Multiple Indicators & Confirmation**
    *   **Topic:** Developing a more robust trading signal by using multiple, non-correlated indicators.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Avoiding signal overload or paralysis by analysis. Using indicators for confirmation (e.g., an oscillator signal confirmed by a candlestick pattern at a support level). Understanding that different indicators measure different things (trend, momentum, volatility).
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Develop a simple trading setup using 2-3 indicators that you've learned (e.g., MACD crossover + RSI confirmation + price above 50-EMA). Manually back-test this setup on one stock for the past year. Document your rules and results.
    *   **Recommended Resources:** Your notes on all indicators learned so far.

*   **Day 42: Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn in Python**
    *   **Topic:** Creating charts and plots of financial data using Python.
    *   **Key Concepts:** `Matplotlib` for basic plotting (line charts, scatter plots, histograms). `Seaborn` for more statistically-oriented and aesthetically pleasing plots. Plotting stock prices, volume, and moving averages.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Using one of your stock DataFrames in Python: 
        1.  Plot the closing price using Matplotlib.
        2.  Plot the volume as a bar chart on a separate subplot below the price chart.
        3.  Calculate a 20-day and 50-day SMA and plot them on the price chart.
        4.  (Optional) Explore Seaborn for a simple distribution plot of daily returns.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   Matplotlib Official Tutorials: [https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
        *   Seaborn Official Tutorials: [https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
        *   Real Python - Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide): [https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/)

*   **Day 43: Calculating Technical Indicators with Python (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI using TA-Lib)**
    *   **Topic:** Programmatically calculating common technical indicators.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Introduction to the `TA-Lib` (Technical Analysis Library) for Python. Installing TA-Lib (can sometimes be tricky, follow instructions carefully). Using TA-Lib functions to calculate SMAs, EMAs, RSI, MACD, etc., on your Pandas DataFrames.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Install TA-Lib. Using a stock DataFrame, calculate and add columns for: 20-day SMA, 50-day EMA, 14-day RSI, and MACD values (MACD line, signal line, histogram). Print the last 5 rows of your DataFrame to verify.
    *   **Recommended Resources:**
        *   TA-Lib Python Wrapper Documentation: [https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/)
        *   TA-Lib Installation Help (search online for OS-specific guides if needed, e.g., "install ta-lib windows/mac/linux").
        *   Tutorials on "python ta-lib tutorial".

*   **Day 44: Review of Week 6 & Advanced TA/Python Practice**
    *   **Topic:** Consolidating knowledge of advanced TA and Python data visualization/indicator calculation.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Review advanced patterns, Fibonacci, combining indicators, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TA-Lib.
    *   **Hands-on Activity:** Choose one stock. Download its data using Python. Calculate several technical indicators using TA-Lib. Plot the price along with 2-3 key indicators using Matplotlib. Write a short technical commentary based on your Python-generated charts and indicators. Continue paper trading, trying to incorporate more advanced patterns or combined indicator signals.
